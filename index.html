        Sei is the first Layer 1 specialized for trading, giving exchanges an unfair advantage.<br> 
        <br>
        
            1. optimizing every layer of the stack to give exchanges an unfair advantage<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        2. backed by Multicoin, Coinbase, Delphi, and a lot of large market makers<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        3. there are already 60+ teams building on top from Solana, Polkadot, NEAR, and Terra<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        By exploring the new design space between app chains and general purpose L1s, Sei has carefully selected a unique set of tradeoffs that make its layer 1 the optimal environment for trading.<br>
        
        Designed from the bottom up to scale, Sei unlocks new possibilities with optimizations including:<br>
        
        
        <br>
        1. Built-in orderbook - solves the age-old orderbook scaling issue<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Frontrunning protection - MEV is a major drawback of popular chains like Ethereum and Solana<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Finality - Sei is the fastest chain to finality at ~600ms, 5x faster than Solana, Sui, and 2x faster than Aptos.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Designed from bottoms-up to scale with the needs of decentralized exchanges, Sei has made several optimizations to Layer 1 to give exchanges an unfair advantage:<br>
        
        
        <br>
        1. Native Order Matching Engine - drives scalability of orderbook DEXs built on Sei<br>
        <br><br>
        2. Frontrunning Protection - combats malicious frontrunning that is rampant in other ecosystems<br>
        <br><br>
        3. Intelligent Block Propagation - improves latency and throughput<br>
        <br><br>
        4. Sub-Second Settlement - Sei is the fastest chain to finality at ~600ms<br>
        <br>
        <br>
The combination of these optimizations makes it possible for new types of financial products to emerge—everything ranging from live sports betting to complex options and futures.<br>

Nearly all Layer 1 chains fall into a barbell distribution with many general-purpose chains on one side (Solana, Aptos, Ethereum) and app-specific chains on the other (dYdX, Osmosis).<br>
There is a massive design space in the middle of that distribution and that is where Sei explores. <br>

Sei unlocks an entirely new design space in between the two - not the general purpose nor app-specific but DEX-specific.<br>

  Use case-specific chains are able to combine the benefits of both, general purpose and app-specific chains.<br>

- The biggest two advantages of general purpose chains tend to come from:<br>
<br>
    1. atomic composability - every app built on top can easily work with each other<br>
    <br>
    2. social coordination - the fact that every project built on layer 1 is the same team (the feeling of everyone in the ecosystem being on 1 team is game-changing because they all work together to build the community, allowing it to grow 10 times faster than if they were fragmented)<br>
    <br>
- The biggest advantage of app-specific chains comes from:<br>
<br>
    1. customizability - if the chain is built around one single application, it can be customized for every aspect<br>
    <br>
    2. native interoperability - if every chain is built with the same stack (ex. Cosmos SDK) chains can easily communicate i.e it’s very easy to be interoperable <br>
    <br>
- Sei has the opportunity to combine all these benefits - composability and coordination from general purpose and customizability and interoperability from more app-specific chains.<br>
- Sei is carefully selecting a unique set of tradeoffs to create the best Layer 1 for DEXs.<br>
